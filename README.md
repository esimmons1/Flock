# Flock
Program made to replicate bird flocking using Biods. Each bird (boid) follows three basic rules: stay close to nearby birds (cohesion), steer the same direction (alignment), and don’t crash into each other (separation). They wrap around the screen, and you can tweak how they behave by changing their view range or force limits. Background’s light gray, birds are black.
